# üè¶ Playwright TypeScript Banking Project

This project tests the **GlobalSQA Banking Project** web application using **Playwright + TypeScript**. It validates customer and manager workflows, deposits, withdrawals, transaction tables, and negative scenarios, demonstrating parallel and cross-browser testing (https://www.globalsqa.com/angularJs-protractor/BankingProject/).  

Tools: TypeScript, Playwright, Node.js, Visual Studio Code, Git & GitHub.  

Tests are organized with Page Object Model and executed using `npx playwright test`. CI/CD workflows will be added to automate test execution on each push.
